# TivWorld
a Zelda-like game

I'm working on that game to learn more about C++.
I started to learn it something like 6 months ago with few tutorials.

I'm coding that game in C++ with SFML (http://www.sfml-dev.org/).

So I'm opened to all the help you can give me to continue my game, to have better knowledge in C++, to have a better organization for my code, to show me things I forgot...

Thank you by advance for all your help ;-)
