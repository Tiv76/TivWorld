# TivWorld
a Zelda-like game

I'm working on that game to learn more about C++.
I started to learn it something like 6 months ago with few tutorials.

I'm coding that game in C++ with SFML (http://www.sfml-dev.org/) and I'm using "tile-mapping".

In my reposit you could find 2 folders :

- The first one 'pictures'
You could find here the tileset I'm using. I will change them later to have my own tileset, I foung those ones on Google to have something ready to use.

- The second one 'levels'
You could find here .txt files used to generate the levels.

So I'm opened to all the help you can give me to continue my game, to have better knowledge in C++, to have a better organization for my code, to show me things I forgot...

Thank you by advance for all your help ;-)
